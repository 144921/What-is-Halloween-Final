      <h2>So How did it get started?</h2>
      <p>To undestand Halloween, you must undestand its history. It has its roots in the Celtic New Year's Eve, or Samhain. The Celts believed that on Samhain, the boundary between the spiritual and physical was weakened and contact with the dead would be enabled. The Celts also feared that the evil spirits would terrorize them that day by causing trouble and damaging crops. And in addition, the spirits would enable the Druids, or the Celtic priests, to allow them to predict the future. To prevent the bad spirits from doing damage, the Celts would put offerings of food to the good sprits and the ghosts of the deceased ancestors to fight off the bad spirits. The Celts would also dress up as evil spirits to confuse the demons.      </p>

        Halloween also had roots in All Saints' Day, which was a holiday established by the Catholic Church to celebrate all martyrs. In 839 AD, Pope Gregory III changed the day of All Saints' Day from May 13 to November 1. This move is usually seen as an attempt by the Church to supplant the pagan Celtic Samhain. The descendants of the Celts, the Irish would celebrate All Saints'(Hallows') Day slightly similar to Samhain, with pagan and Celtic traditions mixed. The Irish would dress up as angels, demons and saints and there would be big bonfires similar to the ones that the Druids used to help predict the future.

      <p>Other modern Halloween traditions are from much later periods. Trick-or-treating has its roots in souling, a practice in which poor people would go from house to house to ask for "soul cakes", a type of biscuit. The "soulers" would offer to pray for the people's souls in return for the soul cakes. Halloween made its way to the United States with the Irish Potato Famine in the 1850s. It was mostly common among the Irish-American Communities, and eventually began to go spread, becoming mainstream between the 1920s and 1950s. And trick-or-treating as we know it began as kids would egg their neighbors' house if they did not get free candy. To combat vandalism, trick-or-treating became more organized and vandalism eventually died. Halloween became an economical success, and it is a popular holiday.

        <h2>What Does The Bible say about Halloween?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Bible does not specifically mention Halloween, but it does mention the practices and darkness associated with Halloween. Here is a look at some Bible verses.
       
      </p>

        <p>
          Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. (Phillipians 4:8)
          </p>
          <p>
          I will destroy your witchcraft
            and you will no longer cast spells. (Micah 5:12)
        </p>
        <p>
          The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the Lord your God has not permitted you to do so. (Deuteronomy 18:14)
        </p>
        <p>
          Reject all kinds of evil.(1 Thessalonians 5:22)
        </p>
        <p>
          Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.(Ephesians 5:11)
          
        </p>  
        <p>
          Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.(3 John 1:11)
          
        </p>
      <p>
        Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. (Romans 12:2)
      </p>
       </div>
      <p>
        As we can see, the Bible clearly rejects Halloween. Christians should not associate themselves with evil, with which Halloween is spiritually linked. Halloween is a holiday clearly linked with paganism and evil spirits (demons). Halloween has not completely lost its roots in paganism and the spiritual that the Church tried to stop, especially if you go to a store with all the ghosts and witches on display. Be clear to stop celebrating Halloween and repent.
